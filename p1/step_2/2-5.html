Popularity is not wrong in and of itself, but it has its own perils. In a <em>free-market</em> economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are doomed to failure. Nobody gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes out of business. But opinions are not the same as material goods or services. They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. In fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many <strong>bad</strong> ones) have been quite unpopular for a long time, and their marginal status has only strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can’t be expressed and recognized.

<h1 class="vv5">Today the Stream is <strong>digital</strong> media’s dominant form of organizing information. </h1>
<p class="vv2">
It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream. I guess it won’t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles. The prominence of the Stream today doesn’t just make vast chunks of the Internet biased against quality — it also means a deep betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.
</p>
<p class="vv3">
There’s no question to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less online today than it was in the past. <strong>New</strong>, <strong>different</strong>, and <strong>challenging</strong> ideas get suppressed by today’s social networks because their ranking strategies prioritize the popular and habitual. <em>(No wonder why Apple is hiring human editors for its news app.)</em> But diversity is being reduced in other ways, and for other purposes.
