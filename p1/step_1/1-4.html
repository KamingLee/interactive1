<strong>Popularity is not wrong</strong> in and of itself, but it has its own perils. In a free-<br>market economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are doomed to<br>failure. Nobody gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and <br>rude servers goes out of business. But opinions are not the same as material <br>goods or services. They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. In <br>fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many bad ones) have been <br>quite unpopular for a long time, and their marginal status has only <br>strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can’t be <br>expressed and recognized.

<br> <h1>Web</h1> <p style="font-size:10px;">
<strong>Today the Stream</strong> is digital media’s dominant form of organizing information. <br>It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my <br>freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream. I guess it won’t be too long <br>before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same <br>principles. The prominence of the Stream today doesn’t just make vast chunks <br>of the Internet biased against quality — it also means a deep betrayal to the <br>diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.

<br><h3>We</h3> <p style="font-size:10px;">
<strong>There’s no question</strong> to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less online <br>today than it was in the past. New, different, and challenging ideas get suppressed <br>by today’s social networks because their ranking strategies prioritize the <br>popular and habitual. (No wonder why Apple is hiring human editors for its news <br>app.)But diversity is being reduced in other ways, and for other purposes.
